The present study focus on the application of data mining techniques to predict future production of crop such as Rice with respect to various climatic conditions observed in last 12 years (2006-2018) in Bangladesh. 
The data mining algorithms â€“Gaussian Process Regression, Support Vector Regression (SMOReg) and Multi-Layer Perceptron are discussed in this paper.

In machine learning, most research has been done for classification, where the single the predicted feature is nominal or discrete. Regression differs from classification in that the output or predicted feature in regression problems is continuous. 

In this paper we will apply these algorithms for prediction of crop production and find the accuracies of algorithms to compare which one gives better result. This research study will add to the literature in the area of technology development that will handle the fluctuations in the prices and will support the suppliers in a useful manner. This application model will help consumers and suppliers to forecast food price.
